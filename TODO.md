Define a Node class to represent a node in the cluster:
a. Node ID
b. Total resources (CPU, GPU, memory)
c. Used resources
d. Available resources
e. Status (active, failed)

Extend the ResourceManager class to manage multiple nodes:
a. Add a new node
b. Remove a node
c. Update node status
d. Get node status
e. Get all nodes

Extend the Scheduler class to support parallelism and distributed computing:
a. Check for available resources in each node
b. Assign jobs to nodes based on available resources and job requirements
c. Handle job dependencies across nodes
d. Distribute jobs across nodes to optimize resource usage and overall runtime

Implement fault tolerance and resilience in the Scheduler class:
a. Detect node failures by monitoring node status
b. Re-queue or reschedule affected jobs to other available nodes
c. Resume partially completed jobs if possible

Add user configuration and preferences:
a. Allow users to set preferences, such as the default number of nodes, resource allocation strategies, and fault tolerance options
b. Load and save user preferences from a configuration file

Implement advanced logging and reporting functionality:
a. Log node-level information, such as node status, resource usage, and failure events
b. Generate reports based on job execution and node performance data
c. Provide visualizations for job and node performance metrics

Implement a user interface or command-line interface (CLI) to interact with MicroSlurm:
a. Submit jobs
b. Query job status
c. Monitor node status
d. Access logs and reports
e. Configure preferences

Implement job pausing and resuming functionality:
a. Pause a running job, releasing its resources and updating its status to "paused"
b. Resume a paused job, re-allocating resources and updating its status to "running"

Implement data checkpointing for jobs to support resuming partially completed jobs:
a. Save intermediate job results at regular intervals
b. Load the latest checkpoint when resuming a job

Add exception handling and error reporting throughout the library:
a. Handle exceptions in job execution, resource allocation, and other critical operations
b. Report errors to the user and log them for further analysis
